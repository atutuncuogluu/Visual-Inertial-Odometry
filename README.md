 Visual Inertial Odometry techniques for UAV within the scope of TEKNOFEST

 ## 07.08.2024 UPDATE
 ### Even though I had to use the old object detection model due to a problem I experienced during the competition, my trajectory method worked quite successfully and placed us 1st in the trajectory category and 5th in the general category. Since the process continues, I will partially share the necessary techniques at the end of the competition.
